# Random-Color-Generator

This is one of my many projects in python.
For this project I am using OpenCV and random to create a random colour generator.
This project was inspired by coolors.co and I wanted to create something similar
However instead of purchasing their subscription for their extra features I created them myself.
This project was made in one day and is still under development
