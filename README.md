Random Colour Generator

The way this project works is by generating an array of five different colours.
There are a handful of methods that change the array.
For example one method is a gradient that takes the averages of 2 colours and returns the values.
I was inspired to make this by a similar website and it's purpose is to inspire me with colour pallets I would not normally think off.
